COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS IN BIVALVES

Room 103 A => Fri, Mar 01, 2019 (09:45 AM - 10:00 AM)

ABSTRACT: 	The function of DNA methylation in species such as bivalves where the limited amount of DNA methylation is predominantly found in gene bodies is not completely understood. One emerging possible explanation is that the role of gene body DNA methylation is dependent on gene function, a potential phenomenon that has arisen from selective pressure on lineage-specific life history traits. We know that in other taxa epigenetic marks are associated with phenotypes independent of genetic variation, the environment can influence DNA methylation, and epigenetic marks can be inherited. Focusing on CpG methylation in several bivalve species the influence of environmental conditions on DNA methylation was examined. This included using a variety of approaches that examine DNA methylation in the context of different controlled and natural conditions in oysters and clams. These combined results suggest a predictable global response to stress in DNA methylation patterns that is impacted by environment, population, and ploidy-level. Together these data suggest DNA methylation is a mechanism regulating the physiological response of marine invertebrates to global ocean change.
